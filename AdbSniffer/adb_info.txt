Extracted from an ArtPad II, model UD-0608-A using ADB Analyzer, a 9500, a Powerbook G3, one dead ADB mouse, a Newton 
keyboard, 4x2.2K resistors, 1 1K in line resistor pack, a bit of solderless breadboard, and some wire.  Not pretty.

By default, this tablet appears at handler 0x3a, and gets moved to handler 0x68 by the Wacom driver.  That's where we 
want to put it, I think.  Is it by chance that 0x68 is a truncation of 0608?  Would a 1212 be moved to 0xcc?  I think 
it likely.  Need to get someone to try, I guess.

DEVICE INFORMATION
==================

Static device information is coded in register 1 and Register 3.  Reg 3 is, as usual, the handler id. 

ADB Register 1 holds 8 bytes, and appears to encode the following:
?? ?? xx xx yy yy ?? ?? 

Resolution of my tablet is 2450 dpi (0x5000 / 2450 = 8, 0x3e00 / 2450 = 6) or 0.01mm

xxxx : maximum x co-ordinate
yyyy : maximum y co-ordinate

items referred to as ?? I haven't figured out yet.

All but the second byte appear to be static data.  Second byte is random, but seems to be fixed per setting of R3, although its value 
doesn't seem to be related to r3 value in any way.

RESET PROCESSING
================

Packets sent after address resolution is finished

Talk		R1	38 20 50 00 3c 00 06 17		// Talk register 1, presumably to determine if this is actually a wacom tablet
Talk		R0	a6 bc 0b 4b 00 80 1f 19		// Talk register 0, doesn't always do this.  Possibly irrelevant, may be triggered 
																			// by normal ADB polling?
Talk		R3	6e 3a											// Talk register 3, find out what handler it's set to.
Talk		R1	38 20 50 00 3c 00 06 17		// Talk register 1, Always an identical result to the previous talk

Listen	R3	6f 68											// Listen register 3, set handler to 68
Talk		R3	6x 68											// Talk register 3, did it take?

Listen	R1	67 68											// Listen register 1, do what?  First byte changes, seems irrelevant.
Talk		R1	38 03 50 00 3c 00 06 17		// After the listen, byte 2 has changed, but there seems to be no reason to it.

Talk		R0														// No data in this case, will repeat if there is any, this is probably a normal poll
Talk		R3	61 68 										// Appears to be normal MacOS ADB init handling, probably not required

POLLING
=======

Despite Dave Fleck's assurances to the contrary, there appears to be nothing over-onerous in the protocol.  Each 
poll interval can result in 8 bytes being sent, with the command byte that makes 9 bytes per packet, at 100Hz, or 8100bit/s.
Even USB 1.1 devices should be able to handle 12Mbit/s, so we're not even close to throttling USB. It has to be said, it is 
pretty close to thrashing  ADB, which could be an issue for OSX, but to be frank, I think Wacom have been talking crap 
since day 1.  Anyway, back to matters in hand.

The tablet polls just like any other device, with a talk R0 command, which returns an 8 byte packet if there's anything to 
report.

In short, it looks like this:

Talk		R0	ss xx xx yy yy pp tx ty 

ss   : status
xxxx : x coordinate
yyyy : y coordinate
pp   : pressure, 
tx   : X tilt, +-127, -ve to the left
ty   : Y tilt, +-127, -ve away from user


The status byte is similar to, but not the same as, that used by the Wacom IV binary protocol:

Bit 	Comment
7			Always 1
6			Pointer in proximity indicator
5			Stylus : 1, Cursor : 0
4			Macro Button Depressed (click)
3			B3     always zero?
2			B2     sidebutton2
1			B1     sidebutton1
0			B0     nib


Button encoding, as given by the nybble defined by B0..B3 depends on the tool in use.  Nothing like a standard 
approach, after all, and this is nothing like one.

If it's a puck:
Button = 1 - Front centre
Button = 2 - Left
Button = 3 - back centre
button = 4 - right

For the stylus (ultrapen eraser), it's all a bit arse arse as the number is a bitmap of the "tip pressed" and button
Button = 1 - 0001 nib pressed
Button = 2 - 0010 side button 1 pressed
Button = 3 - 0011 nib pressed and side button 1 pressed
button = 4 - 0100 side button 2 pressed in proximity *or* eraser in proximity
Button = 5 - 0101 Eraser pressed *or* side button 2 pressed and tip pressed
Button = 6 - 0110 Eraser in proximity with side button 1 pressed
Button = 7 - 0111 can't do this, I don't think.

A little explanation from the wacom docs...
# When the eraser is in proximity of the tablet, or the second side switch is pressed while the pen is 
# in proximity, then the tablet will transmit a switch number of 4. When the eraser tip is pressed 
# against the tablet, or the second side switch is pressed while the pen tip is pressed against the 
# tablet, then the tablet will transmit a switch state of 5. 
#
# Note that the tablet cannot detect the difference between an eraser in proximity and a pen tip with 
# the 2nd side switch pressed in proximity (switch state 4), and it cannot detect the difference 
# between an eraser pressed against the tablet and a tip pressed against the tablet while the 2nd side 
# switch is pressed (switch state 5).
# 
# Note: The WACOM drivers differentiate between the eraser function and the second side switch 
# function by analyzing the first switch state transmitted after the pen enters proximity: if the initial 
# switch state is 4, the driver assumes that an eraser is now in proximity, and if the initial switch 
# state is 0 and changes later to 4 or 5, then the driver assumes that the pen tip is in proximity and 
# that the 2nd side switch was pressed at the later moment. 


Back to the rest of the packet:

Following the status byte, there are 2 bytes of X coordinate, and 2 bytes of Y coordinate, both of which 
are clipped to the maximum dimension as specified in the register 1 packet, then one byte of signed pressure, with -128 being the minimum / off tablet reading, and 127 being the highest, and a signed byte each for x tilt and y tilt.  X tilt is negative to the left, y is negative *away* from the user.

For a puck, pp, tx and ty will be zero


OUT OF PROXIMITY
================

When the tool moves out of proximity, you will get a packet with a status of '80' or 'A0' (depending on tool),
with last received data in the rest of the packet.  The status byte will look like this, even if a button was 
pressed as the tool went out of prox.

ss = %10x00000

MACRO BUTTONS
=============

Macro buttons are indicated by a single "out of proximity" message, but with the button depressed flag set, as follows:

Talk		R0 %10x1xxxx 00 bb 00 00 00 00 00

bb is the button number, and the x's in the status byte change depending on tool and button used.  All other data is zero.


OTHER STUFF
===========

The Stylus seems to need occasional R2 packets as well, not sure what this is for, there seems no rhyme or reason 
to when they are requested, and what they contain seems random.  8 bytes of random.  They are requested *directly* 
after an Talk R0 event (i.e. not polled), and followed, again immediately, immediately by an talk R0.
They appear to be applied to device address ^ 0x08, which is unused (by chance?) but that could be my stupid 
analyzer setup playing up.  I have no idea what these are, anyway, but the R0 data seems to be enough to be going 
on with for the moment.


R2 Data (without driver installed)
==================================

Further analysis needed on this
R2 appears to always return data, it could be polled without requiring a kernel extension at all, but we'd have to deal with 
(i.e. block) the R0 data being picked up by the mouse handler.  Not sure what the format of the status byte in R2 is, the rest 
seems consistent with R0 and the handler having been changed.

ADB Parser from Griffin links 3a to "ArtZ" models, 6a to "Intuos", which might well make sense.  Were there any other families with ADB interfaces?
